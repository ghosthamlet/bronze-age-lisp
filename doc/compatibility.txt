        Bronze Age Lisp Compatibility Notes
        ===================================

Part I - Compliance with language definition
============================================

    Bronze Age Lisp supports the ten core modules
  defined in [KR chapters 4 and 5], and the optional
  modules Continuations, Encapsulations, Promises,
  Keyed dynamic variables, Keyed static variables,
  Characters, Strings and Ports (note that specification
  of the last three modules in [KR] is not complete).

    Bronze Age Lisp supports the module Numbers,
  but it does not support the optional modules
  Inexact, Narrow Inexact, Rational, Real
  and Complex. That is, Bronze Age lisp supports
  only integers and the exact infinity values
  #e-infinity and #e+infinity.

    The lack of the advanced numeric features means
  that Bronze Age Lisp is NOT comprehensive implementation
  of Kernel in the sense of [KR section 1.3.2].

Robustness
----------

  The implementation is not robust. Not all errors
  describedin the Kernel Report are signalled.

  Namely, the result of evaluation in tail position
  of ($and ...) and ($or ...) is never checked,
  see also [KR section 6.1.4].

Implementation restrictions
---------------------------

  Heap capacity is fixed when the interpreter
  is built. Therefore, number of objects, length
  of strings and range of integers supported
  by the implementation is bounded.

Part II - Compatibility with Klisp
==================================

  Bronze Age Lisp supports most of the functionality
  provided by Klisp under the modules Keywords,
  Errors, Libraries and Ports. Support for the
  modules Characters, Strings, Vectors, Bytevectors
  and System is work in progress.

Characters
----------

  In contrast to klisp (default branch), Bronze
  Age Lisp character type can represent all unicode
  code points. Unicode characters can be also used
  in strings, symbols and keywords. The interpreter
  does not (yet) perform normalization of unicode
  input.

  The combiners char-alphabetic? and char-whitespace?
  support unicode.

Strings
-------

  All strings are immutable mutable. The string ports
  can be used instead of string mutation combiners.

Ports
-----

  UTF-8 encoding is always assumed for textual ports.

Part III - Compatibility with the host environment
==================================================

  The interpreter is an executable file in ELF format
  which can be run in under Linux operating system
  on x86 (32-bit) platforms. Other platforms are not
  supported.

  The interpreter uses only the following linux
  system calls:

                 system call number on x86
    ----------------------------------------
    read         0x03
    write        0x04
    open         0x05
    close        0x06
    ioctl        0x36
    gettimeofday 0x4E
    rt_sigaction 0xAE
    sigaltstack  0xBA

  The interpreter uses the "vsyscall" mechanism.

  The text user interface of the read-eval-print loop
  is expected to be run from a terminal emulator
  which supports ANSI escape sequences e.g. xterm
  or Konsole.
